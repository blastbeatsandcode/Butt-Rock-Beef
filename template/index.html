	<h1>Butt-Rock Beef v0.1</h1>
	<p>This is a silly project created on a whim because TRAPT (yes, the band that made like one song that a lot of people liked circa 2002-ish) keeps trying to stay relevant by starting "twitter beef". The question is, does this beef correlate to changes in plays on Spotify?</p>
